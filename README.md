# RideShare

RideShare is a prototype of an iOS app that makes it simple for students to filter their preferences, including preferred date, time, and destination locations, to schedule intrastate long-distance rides. Currently, universities have RideShare groups online where they have to search endlessly through Facebook pages to find an accommodation that best suits their carpooling needs.
